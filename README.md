## Program Function
This application generates a list of recipes that the user can cook based on the ingredients that the user has. The collection of ingredients used in our algorithm is created via the user's interaction with the application (e.g. the user adding ingredients from an ingredient catalog into the fridge or removing ingredients from the fridge). After the list of recommended recipes is generated and displayed, the user may add selected recipes into a collection of favorited recipes. When exiting the application, the user's collection of ingredients and favorite recipes are saved and loaded when the user starts the application again.
